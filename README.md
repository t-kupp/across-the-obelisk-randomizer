A team randomizer for the game [Across the Obelisk](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1385380/Across_the_Obelisk/)!
My friend and I were tired of always playing the same characters, so we built a randomizer to force us to try new team compilations.
You can set the amount of characters a player controls (useful if you are not playing with a full 4 player party) and even choose which of the currently 20 avaiable characters each player wants to have in the randomize pool!
